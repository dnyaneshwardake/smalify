							information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy
							Policy, and we may use it or disclose it to others without
							limitation and for any purpose.</p>

							Privacy Policy and for the following purposes:</p>

							Information</h4>

						<p>We will only collect, use and share your Personal
							Information where we are satisfied that we have an appropriate
							legal basis to do this. This may be because:</p>

						<ul class="custom-ul">
							<li>we need to use your Personal Information to perform a
								contract or take steps to enter into a contract with you. For
								example, when you provide your information with us in order to
								apply to a job position in Smalify.<br />
							</li>
							<li>we need to use your Personal Information for our
								legitimate interest as a commercial organization. For example,
								we may collect your Personal Information in order to communicate
								with you and present you marketing materials and opportunities
								regarding our products and services.<br />
							</li>
							<li>we need to use your Personal Information to comply with
								a relevant legal or regulatory obligation that we have; or<br />

							we collect</h4>

						<p>We may share your Personal Information in the manner and
							for the purposes described below:</p>

						<ul class="custom-ul">
							<li>with other companies within our Group, where such
								disclosure is required to assist us in fulfilling the purposes
								described in this Privacy Policy or to manage our business; and<br />
							</li>
							<li>with third parties and service providers who help our
								business (e.g. for data analytics purposes, communicating
								promotional and informational materials, etc.). These third
								parties have agreed to confidentiality restrictions and use any
								Personal Information we share with them or which they collect on
								our behalf for the purpose of providing the contracted service
								to us.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							<br /> We may also disclose Personal Information, or any
							information you submitted us, if we have a good faith belief that
							disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary
							to: (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process
							or governmental request; (ii) enforce our policies, including
							investigations of potential violations thereof; (iii)
							investigate, detect, prevent, or take action regarding illegal
							activities or other wrongdoing, suspected fraud or security
							issues; (iv) to establish or exercise our rights to defend
							against legal claims; (v) prevent harm to the rights, property or
							safety of us, our users, yourself or any third party; or (vi) for
							the purpose of collaborating with law enforcement agencies or in
							case we find it necessary in order to enforce intellectual
							property or other legal rights.
						</p>

						<h4 style="color: orange">Marketing</h4>

						<p>
							We may use Personal Information to let you know about our
							products and services that we believe will be of interest to your
							company. We may contact you by email, post, or telephone or
							through other communication channels that we think you may find
							helpful. In all cases, we will respect your preferences for how
							you would like us to manage marketing activity with you.<br /> <br />
							To protect your privacy and to ensure you have control over how
							we manage marketing activities with you:
						</p>

						<ul class="custom-ul">
							<li>we will take steps to limit direct marketing to a
								reasonable and proportionate level and only send you
								communications which we believe may be of interest or relevance
								to you;<br />
							</li>
							<li>you can ask us to stop direct marketing at any time you
								can ask us to stop sending email marketing, by following the
								"unsubscribe" link you will find on all the email marketing
								messages we send you.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You can change the way your browser manages cookies, which
							may be used to deliver online advertising, by following the
							settings on your browser as explained above.</p>

						<h4 style="color: orange">Security of your Personal
							Information</h4>

						<p>We take security very seriously. We have implemented and
							maintain appropriate technical and organisational security
							measures, policies and procedures designed to reduce the risk of
							accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorised disclosure or
							access to such information appropriate to the nature of the
							information concerned. Measures we take include, for example:</p>

						<ul class="custom-ul">
							<li>placing confidentiality requirements on our staff
								members and service providers;<br />
							</li>
							<li>destroying or permanently anonymising Personal
								Information if it is no longer needed for the purposes for which
								it was collected; and<br />
							</li>
							<li>applying security controls in the storage and disclosure
								of your Personal Information to prevent unauthorised access to
								it.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							<br /> As the security of information depends in part on the
							security of the computer you use to communicate with us and the
							security you use to protect User IDs and passwords, please take
							appropriate measures to protect this information. However, due to
							the open communication nature of the Internet, we cannot
							guarantee that communications between you and Smalify, and
							Smalify and you, will be free from unauthorized access by third
							parties.
						</p>

						<h4 style="color: orange">Storing your Personal Information</h4>

						<p>
							We will store your Personal Information for as long as is
							reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected,
							as explained in this privacy policy. Where your information is no
							longer needed, we will ensure that it is disposed of in a secure
							manner. In some circumstances we may store your Personal
							Information for longer periods of time, for instance where we are
							required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax,
							accounting requirements.<br /> <br /> In specific circumstances
							we may store your Personal Information for longer periods of time
							so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in
							the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably
							believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your
							Personal Information or dealings.
						</p>

						<h4 style="color: orange">Transferring Personal Information
							globally</h4>

						<p>
							We operate on a global basis. Accordingly, your Personal
							Information may be transferred and stored in countries outside of
							Europe that are subject to different standards of data
							protection.<br /> <br /> We will take appropriate steps to
							ensure that transfers of Personal Information are made in
							accordance with applicable law and carefully managed to protect
							your privacy rights and interests, and limited to countries which
							are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection
							or where we can be satisfied that alternative arrangement are in
							place to protect your privacy rights. To this end:
						</p>

						<ul class="custom-ul">
							<li>we ensure transfers within our Group will adhere to
								applicable privacy and data protection laws and that such
								transfers ensure a consistent level of protection wherever it is
								transferred within the Group;<br />
							</li>
							<li>where we transfer your Personal Information outside of
								the Smalify Group to third parties who provide us services, we
								obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your
								Personal Information; or<br />
							</li>
							<li>where we receive requests for information from law
								enforcement or regulators, we carefully validate these requests
								before any Personal Information is disclosed.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4 style="color: orange">Minors</h4>

						<p>
							The website is not directed nor targeted to children under the
							age of 16. Smalify will not knowingly collect information from
							children. If you are under 16, you may not submit information
							about yourself to us. In the event that we become aware that a

						<h4 style="color: orange">Cookies</h4>

						<p>
							Our website uses cookies, pixel tags and other forms of
							identification and local storage (together referred to as
							“tags/files” hereunder) to distinguish you from other users of
							the website. This helps us provide you with a good experience
							when you browse the website also allows us to improve and
							customize our websites and the ways we communicate with you.<br />
							<br /> In many cases, these tags/files lead to the use of your
							device’s processing or storage capabilities. Some of these
							tags/files are set by Smalify itself, others by third parties;
							some only last as long as your browser session, while others can
							stay active on your device for a longer period of time.<br /> <br />
							These tags/files can fall into several categories: (i) those that
							are necessary for functionality or services that you request or
							for the transmission of communications (functionality
							tags/files); (ii) those that we use to carry out website
							performance and audience metrics (analytics tags/files) and (iii)
							the rest (tracking across a network of other websites,
							advertising, etc.).<br /> <br /> Internet browsers allow you to
							change your cookie settings, for instance to block certain kinds
							of cookies or files. You can therefore block cookies by
							activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse
							the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your
							browser settings to block all cookies, you may not be able to
							access all or parts of the website, due to the fact that some may
							be functionality cookies. To consult the list of cookies we use
							on our website, please check your browser's instructions.<br />

						<h4 style="color: orange">Corporate transaction</h4>

						<p>We may share Information, including Personal Information,
							in the event of a corporate transaction (e.g. sale of a
							substantial part of our business, merger, consolidation or asset
							sale). In the event of the above, our acquiring company will
							assume the rights and obligations as described in this Privacy
							Policy.</p>

						<h4 style="color: orange">Updates to this Policy</h4>

						<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change,
